# Castle Defender Prototype
 
## Info:
A college project made in Unity in 4 months.
A multiplayer strategy castle defender game prototype, uses custome netcode.
I plan on remaking this game as it is just a prototype.


## How to set up:
First, Download & unzip the myBuild folder.
Then open up 3 instances of the program.
On all instances click the LAN Game button.
On 1 instance select the Host Server Button, then minimize the window.
On the other instances select Start Client button.
From here you need to enter in a name on each instance, select a leader, & select are you ready.
The game will then start.
